## What I'm Working On

I work as a network engineer intern. Working on developing [RINA](https://pouzinsociety.org/) router software implementations ([P4](https://p4.org/), [Netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/)).

I studied Telecommunication Engineering's bachelor (major in Networks) at UPC in Barcelona and graduated in 2020. Currently I am doing a [MSc in advanced telecommunications technologies](https://matt.masters.upc.edu/) (e.g machine learning, 5G, cybersecurity).

On my free time I volunteer on cooperation tech projects. Currently deploying an intranet in Gandiol, Senegal with [Hahatay](https://hahatay.org/index.php/es/).

## Side Projects

### Open Arms: Origine

Torture, extortion and even death are common situations faced during the journey to Europe. Migration is a fundamental right, and we defend it as such, but it is important that the decision to migrate is well-informed and chosen in freedom. [More info here](https://www.openarms.es/en/our-missions/africa)

Detailed techincal project report can be found [here](https://www.upc.edu/ccd/ca/accions-al-sud/projectes-2019/a034), as well as developed open source tools available at [@aucoop](https://github.com/aucoop/).

### Blood Pressure Under Pressure

[Checkout project website](https://sergio-gimenez.github.io/bpup-website)  
Client / server application based on mobile devices and open software OpenMRS that allows the automated collection of biomedical data in areas with little or no coverage of mobile communications. This system is aimed to local agents with low or null medical and technological knowledge that will improve the treatment of hypertension in remote areas.

### ieMaps

[Ceckout projet repo](https://github.com/sergio-gimenez/ieMaps)  
ieMaps is an inclusive and eco-friendly Google Maps implementation, a project made by a 4-people group in the HackUPC 2019 and then presented as final project from the BSc course on Distributed Systems Applications.

### Dyscaperoom

[Checkout website project](https://dislexiaupc.github.io/)  
Discovering dyslexia through the technology of VR. Project presented in [Everis](https://www.everis.com/global/en) within the UPC.

## Non-Formal Education

I've been a basketball player, as well as coach of different teams, gender and ages. I learnt a lot from it and part of who I am right now is due to basketball. I'll never be enough grateful for all basketball gave me thoughout those years.

I've been a member of [AEGEE](https://www.aegee.org/) and participated in [Summer Universities](https://www.projects.aegee.org/suct/), which are events in europe organized from young volunteers, to other students from europe.
